            <h2>Mohingar</h2>
            <p>
                Mohinga (Burmese: မုန့်ဟင်းခါး; MLCTS: mun.hang: hka:,
                IPA: [mo̰ʊɰ̃hɪ́ɰ̃ɡá]; also spelt mont hin gar) is a rice
                noodle and fish soup from Myanmar and an essential part
                of Burmese cuisine, considered by many to be the
                national dish of Myanmar. Mohinga is readily
                available in most parts of the country, sold by street
                hawkers and roadside stalls in larger cities. Mohinga
                is traditionally eaten for breakfast, but today is
                eaten at any time of day.Mohinga is a very common
                breakfast dish in Myanmar, and available as an
                "all-day breakfast" in many towns and cities.Mohinga
                can be served as a formal dish made from scratch as
                well as from a ready-made powder used for making the
                broth. Mohinga used to be available only early in the
                morning and at street pwès (open air stage
                performances), zat pwès
                (open air dance performances) or theatres at night.
                Street hawkers often sell mohinga, with some carrying
                the soup cauldron on a stove on one side of a shoulder
                pole, with rice vermicelli and other ingredients, along
                with bowls and spoons, on the other.Trishaw peddlers
                began to appear in the 1960s and some of them set
                up pavement stalls making mohinga available all day.

            <h2>Ohn no khao swè</h2>
            <p>
                Ohn no khao swè (Burmese: အုန်းနို့ခေါက်ဆွဲ; MLCTS: un: nui.
                hkauk hcwai:; IPA: [ʔóʊɰ̃ no̰ kʰaʊʔ sʰwɛ́]) is a Burmese
                dish consisting of wheat noodles in a curried chicken
                and coconut milk broth thickened with gram flour
                (chickpea flour). The dish is often garnished with
                crisp fried bean fritters, sliced raw onions, chillies, crisp noodles, and slices of hard-boiled egg,
                and zested with lime or lemon juice and fish sauce.
                Due to the popular[clarification needed] link between co
                conut milk and hypertension,[citation needed] a variation which uses evaporated milk instead of coconut
                milk is also available in certain restaurants. The rest of the ingredients are the same. A dry noodle
                form of this dish, called shwedaung khao swe (ရွှေတောင်ခေါက်ဆွဲ), consists of egg noodles tossed in a
                chicken curry cooked in coconut milk gravy.
                Ohn no khao swè resembles other coconut milk based
                noodle soups in Southeast Asia, including the Malaysian
                laksa, and the khao soi of Chiang Mai and Luang
                Prabang. The Indian khow suey and Pakistani khausa
                descend from the Burmese ohn no khao swè, likely
                coinciding with the mass exodus of Burmese Indians
                in the 1960s back to South Asia, and remains a
                popular dish in Eastern India.
